## Hi there 👋 ☕

# We're Vendaly

A sophisticated platform to simplify the event vendor booking and management process.

Using analytics and automation, Vendaly helps event organisers manage everything from sourcing, enquiring, confirming, and on the on-the-day updates from their vendors. Vendors are able to upload key documentation like public liability and council registration, meaning less administration before an event. Finally, both parties are able to rate and review, ensuring transparency for future clients. Vendaly provides a whole host of features to simplify and optimise event vendor management in one easy to use platform.
